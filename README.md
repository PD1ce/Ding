# Ding

A work-in-progress from last year.  A lot of this was iteration and testing and I can tell looking back there are a lot of
poor practices in place regarding optional checking and unwrapping.  Hopefully have the time soon to update it
to a newer version of Swift and get an initial released.

Lot of reused code as well in places that could benefit from functional porgramming practices or subclassing some basic UI elements.
